	'T'	- Abnormal termination of the process. The process is terminated with all the consequences of _exit() except that the status made available to wait() and waitpid()  indicates abnormal termination by the specified signal.
	'A'	- Abnormal termination of the process. Additionally, implementation-defined abnormal termination actions, such as creation of a core file, may occur.
	'I'	- Ignore the signal.
	'S'	- Stop the process.
	'C'	- Continue the process, if it is stopped; otherwise, ignore the signal.
